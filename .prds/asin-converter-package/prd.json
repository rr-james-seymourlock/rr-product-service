    "title": "ASIN Converter Package",
    "overview": "A TypeScript package (@rr/asin-converter) that converts Amazon ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) identifiers to universal product identifiers (UPC, SKU, MPN) via the Synccentric product database API. Includes an HTTP API endpoint (POST /product-identifiers/asins) for batch ASIN conversion with parallel processing and granular error handling.",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-12-08"
  },
  "problemStatement": {
    "problem": "Amazon ASINs are proprietary identifiers that cannot be used to match products across other retailers or internal catalogs. To enable cross-retailer product matching, analytics, and inventory integration, we need to convert ASINs to standard identifiers like UPC (Universal Product Code), SKU, or MPN (Manufacturer Part Number). Without this conversion capability, Amazon product data remains siloed and cannot participate in multi-retailer workflows.",
    "marketOpportunity": "Amazon is the largest e-commerce platform, and many Rakuten merchants also sell on Amazon. Converting ASINs to universal identifiers enables: cross-retailer price comparison, unified product catalogs, affiliate tracking across platforms, and inventory synchronization. The Synccentric API provides access to a comprehensive product database mapping ASINs to standard identifiers.",

    ]
  },
  "solutionOverview": {
    "description": "A standalone package that wraps the Synccentric product database API with TypeScript types, Zod validation, comprehensive error handling, and structured logging. The convertAsins() function accepts an array of ASINs and returns matched UPC/SKU/MPN identifiers. Five custom error classes cover all failure scenarios (InvalidInput, Configuration, ApiRequest, ApiResponse, ProductNotFound). An HTTP endpoint at POST /product-identifiers/asins provides batch conversion with parallel processing, returning per-item success/failure results. The endpoint supports 1-10 ASINs per request with 10-second timeout protection.",
