  "introduction": {
    "title": "Product Event Normalizer Package",
    "overview": "A TypeScript package (@rr/product-event-normalizer) that processes raw product view events from Rakuten apps and browser extensions (PDP page visits), normalizes the structure, extracts and consolidates product identifiers from multiple sources (schema.org data, URL patterns, direct SKU/GTIN fields), and outputs a clean array of enriched product objects with comprehensive identifier coverage.",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-12-09"
  },
  "problemStatement": {
    "problem": "Our apps and browser extensions capture product view data when users visit product detail pages (PDPs) across thousands of merchant sites. This data is richer than cart data because it often includes schema.org structured data with SKUs, GTINs, MPNs, brands, and other product metadata extracted directly from the page. However, the raw event JSON has inconsistent field names between Toolbar and App sources (e.g., 'sku' vs 'sku_list', 'offers' vs 'offer_list'), arrays of varying lengths for multi-variant products, and product identifiers scattered across multiple fields (sku, gtin, productID, mpn, offers[].sku, urlToSku, priceToSku). We need a single package that consolidates all available identifiers, normalizes the structure, and outputs clean product arrays ready for analytics and catalog matching.",
    "marketOpportunity": "Product view data is the richest source of product identifiers in our pipeline - often containing SKUs, GTINs, and MPNs that aren't available in cart data. With millions of PDP visits daily, normalizing this data enables: (1) Higher product match rates for catalog integration, (2) Brand-level analytics and reporting, (3) Price tracking and competitive intelligence, (4) Product recommendation improvements through better identification. The schema.org data extraction already exists - we just need to normalize and consolidate it effectively.",
    "targetUsers": [
      "Data engineers building Snowflake pipelines that consume product view events",
      "Analytics teams needing clean product data with brand and category information",
      "ML engineers training models on product browsing behavior",

      "Backend services performing real-time product analysis"
    ]
  },
  "solutionOverview": {
    "description": "A lightweight package that accepts raw product view event JSON and outputs an array of normalized ViewedProduct objects. The normalizer: (1) handles both Toolbar and App field naming conventions, (2) consolidates product identifiers from all available sources (sku, gtin, productID, mpn, offers, urlToSku, priceToSku, plus URL extraction), (3) maps fields to consistent camelCase schema, (4) handles multi-product pages (product listing pages that sometimes get captured), (5) correlates offers with their URLs and SKUs, (6) includes store context and rich metadata (brand, category, color, rating), and (7) returns a frozen array of ViewedProduct objects. The output schema extends CartProduct to maintain compatibility while adding PDP-specific fields.",
