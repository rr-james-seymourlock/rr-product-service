    "title": "Product ID Extraction Store Onboarding MCP Tool",
    "overview": "An MCP server tool that guides developers through configuring product ID extraction from URLs for new stores. The tool analyzes product URLs to identify SKU/ID patterns, generates store-registry regex configurations, creates product-id-extractor test fixtures, validates extraction accuracy, and automates the git workflow. This enables anyone to easily add URL-based product ID extraction support for new merchant stores without understanding regex or the codebase structure.",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-12-12"
  },
  "problemStatement": {
    "problem": "Adding new stores to the product service requires deep knowledge of multiple parts of the codebase: understanding URL patterns, writing regex in ts-regex-builder format, creating JSON fixtures with correct structure, and following proper git workflows. This process is error-prone, time-consuming, and creates a high barrier to contribution. Developers must manually analyze URLs, guess at patterns, write complex regex, and ensure test coverage - all while maintaining consistency with existing code patterns.",
    "marketOpportunity": "With approximately 4,000 Rakuten merchant stores to support, streamlining the store onboarding process is critical. Currently, adding a single store can take 30-60 minutes for experienced developers and much longer for newcomers. An MCP-guided workflow could reduce this to under 5 minutes while improving quality and consistency. This also enables non-engineers (product managers, analysts) to contribute store configurations by simply providing URLs.",
    "targetUsers": [
      "Engineers adding new store configurations to the product service",
      "QA engineers validating and expanding store coverage",
      "Product managers who want to quickly add support for new merchant partners",
      "External contributors unfamiliar with the codebase internals"
    ]
  },
  "solutionOverview": {
    "description": "Build MCP tools within packages/mcp-server that provide a guided, conversational workflow for store onboarding. The tools will: (1) Collect store metadata (ID, name, domain), (2) Accept and validate 5-50 example product URLs, (3) Filter out non-product URLs (category, cart, checkout pages), (4) Analyze URL patterns to identify extractable product IDs, (5) Present findings to user for confirmation, (6) Generate store-registry config with ts-regex-builder patterns, (7) Create product-id-extractor JSON fixtures, (8) Run extraction tests to validate patterns, (9) Create feature branch, commit changes, and open PR to main.",
    "keyFeatures": [
      "Store existence check - detect if store already exists in registry with option to update/expand",
      "URL validation and filtering - identify and remove non-product URLs (category pages, cart, checkout, homepage)",
      "Pattern analysis engine - analyze URLs to identify product ID locations (path segments, query params) and formats",
      "Interactive confirmation - show user identified patterns and extracted IDs before generating code",
      "Store config generation - create ts-regex-builder patterns for store-registry/src/config.ts",
      "Fixture generation - create JSON test fixtures for product-id-extractor/src/__fixtures__/{store}.json",
      "Extraction validation - run tests to verify patterns correctly extract IDs from all provided URLs",
      "Git workflow automation - create named branch, commit with conventional message, open PR to main",
      "Update mode - add new URL patterns to existing stores without overwriting current configuration"
    ],
    "successMetrics": [
      "Time to add new store reduced from 30-60 minutes to under 5 minutes",
      "100% of generated patterns pass extraction tests before commit",
      "Zero manual regex writing required by contributors",
      "All PRs follow consistent naming and commit message conventions",
      "Support adding 10+ stores per day with minimal engineering overhead"
